# docker-compose

This repository serves as a centralized collection of `docker-compose` files for various services and applications I use personally. The goal is to keep these configurations organized and easily deployable.

## Structure
Each service or a related group of services is typically stored in its own dedicated subdirectory.

/
├── service-one/
│   └── docker-compose.yml
├── service-two/
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   └── .env  # Example: environment variables
└── ...

This structure helps in managing configurations independently for each service.

## Usage
To start a specific service or group of services defined in a subdirectory:
1.  Navigate into the desired service's directory:
    ```
    cd path/to/service-directory
    ```
2.  Run the `docker compose up` command (using the v2 command syntax):
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
